This project focuses on predicting the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic using machine learning techniques. Leveraging one of the most popular datasets in data science, we aim to explore and model the factors contributing to passenger survival.

Project Overview
The Titanic Survival Prediction dataset, made famous by Kaggle, includes information on Titanic passengers and their survival status. This project uses data science and machine learning techniques to analyze key features (such as age, gender, class, and fare) and build a predictive model.

Dataset
The Titanic dataset is publicly available through Kaggle's Titanic Challenge. It contains the following columns:

PassengerId: Unique ID for each passenger
Survived: Survival status (0 = No, 1 = Yes)
Pclass: Ticket class (1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd)
Name: Passenger name
Sex: Gender
Age: Age of the passenger
SibSp: Number of siblings/spouses aboard
Parch: Number of parents/children aboard
Ticket: Ticket number
Fare: Ticket fare
Cabin: Cabin number (if available)
Embarked: Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg; Q = Queenstown; S = Southampton)
